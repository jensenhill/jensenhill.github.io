QR Inspector is a single page web application (SPA) designed to improve QR code transparency. Before execution, users can see the QR code contents, such as a full URL or Wi-Fi network credentials, allowing them to assess its validity. For URLs, the website contents will be automatically scanned for malware using the VirusTotal API. These changes aim to facilitate users to protect their device's security, helping them avoid scams, malware and everything in between.
